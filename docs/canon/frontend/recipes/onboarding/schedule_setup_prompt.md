## Final Intended Role
A first-run surface that introduces one setup decision at a time, avoids calendar permission during onboarding, and explains local trust without marketing or assistant framing.

## User Perception
The user should understand one setup choice and its local trust implication without being pushed through permissions or assistant setup.

## Why This Surface Exists
This recipe defines the intended final-state visual contract for Schedule Setup Prompt: what the user sees first, which Ambitions object owns the surface, how source/proof/receipt meaning appears, and which accessibility and anti-drift constraints govern future implementation. It remains design canon only; it is not SwiftUI instruction, screenshot proof, implementation status, or release evidence.

## Region-by-Region Recipe

### Region 1: Single setup prompt

- Purpose: Orient the user to the current object, destination, and state before any action is offered.
- Contains: Single setup prompt; current First Run Root state; origin context when this is a drill-down or transient surface.
- Primitives: Compact Surface Header, Context Crown, LuminousTrace, semantic labels.
- Typography: SF-first semantic type; region label stays compact, object/action text gets hierarchy only when it owns the current decision.
- Spacing: Attached to the object it explains; dense native rhythm with enough separation to avoid card-stack equivalence.
- Materials: GraphiteRecess as default ground; QuietGlass only for transient inspectable layers; LuminousTrace only where state or origin attachment needs to be visible.
- Color/state behavior: Meaning is carried by label, shape, placement, and accessibility text before color; color only reinforces state.
- Icons/chevrons: SF Symbols or chevrons clarify navigation, source, lock/protected, receipt, warning, or disclosure; icons never carry meaning alone.
- Labels: Use Ambitions-native language for One choice per screen, no onboarding calendar permission request, local trust explanation, visible later path.
- CTAs: None unless the header owns a back, close, or setup-later action.
- Receipts/proof: Source, proof, receipt, or explicit no-receipt reason remains visually attached to the changed or inspected object.
- Interaction meaning: Tap or back/close controls preserve origin and do not mutate data.
- Accessibility intent: VoiceOver names region, object, state, source/proof availability, and available action in that order.
- ADHD usability intent: The region reduces choice load by keeping one decision or one state explanation dominant.
- Forbidden treatments: Generic dashboard modules, equal card stack, decorative celestial effects, chatbot framing, shame/score/streak language, color-only state, or retired top-level destination language.

## Primitive Inventory
GraphiteRecess, QuietGlass, LuminousTrace, CelestialField when semantic orientation is needed, Context Crown where orientation matters, Source Freshness Badge, Receipt System, Proof Trail, chevrons/disclosure rows, SF Symbols, semantic labels, primary/secondary/destructive/disabled CTA treatments.

## Object Inventory
First Run Root, plus any visible Receipt System, Closure System, Recommendation Source System, Proof Trail System, Commitment Staging Tray, Reflow Preview Tray, Personal Runtime, or source/proof objects referenced by this surface.

## Typography Recipe
SF-first semantic type. The dominant object or decision owns the strongest weight; explanatory source/proof text remains compact but readable. Dynamic Type must preserve First Run Root, the source/proof line, the primary command, and the recovery or cancel path.

## Spacing Recipe
Use a dense native iPhone rhythm: object-attached spacing, grouped rows only where they represent the same object, and no equal-weight dashboard/card stack. Primary controls remain thumb-zone aware with at least 44 pt touch intent.

## Material Recipe
GraphiteRecess is the ground. QuietGlass is reserved for sheets, trays, overlays, and inspectable transient layers. LuminousTrace expresses origin, attachment, source freshness, protection, pressure, or continuity. CelestialField appears only when it carries orientation or relationship meaning.

## Color and State Recipe
Color reinforces semantic state but never owns it. Fresh, stale, protected, pressure, blocked, waiting, recovery, local-only, disabled, receipt-confirmed, and unresolved states require visible labels, shape/placement, and accessibility text.

## Icon, Chevron, and Disclosure Recipe
Use SF Symbols where possible. Chevron means deeper inspection or navigation, not decoration. Icons must be paired with visible text or accessibility labels, especially for source, proof, protected, pressure, warning, receipt, and recovery meanings.

## CTA Recipe
One primary CTA maximum at rest. Secondary actions are quieter, cancel remains reachable, destructive actions are explicit and receipt-backed, and disabled actions explain what is needed without shame.

## Label and Microcopy Recipe
Use plain Ambitions language: Start here, Shape Time, Still counts, Source, Why this?, Receipt, Needs a Place, Protected, Waiting, Blocked, Needs recovery, and local trust terms where relevant. Avoid AI confidence, model language, productivity scores, overdue/failure copy, motivational filler, and retired top-level destination phrasing.

## Receipt / Proof / Source Recipe
Meaningful changes expose an expected receipt, existing receipt, proof link, source basis, or an explicit no-receipt reason. Proof is object-linked evidence, not decoration. Source freshness can be fresh, stale, unavailable, local-only, or unresolved and must be inspectable.

## State Model
default, active, empty, local-only, source unavailable, stale source, disabled, receipt-confirmed, unresolved direction, not started, in progress, skipped for later, completed, permission deferred.

## Allowed States
- default
- active
- empty
- local-only
- source unavailable
- stale source
- disabled
- receipt-confirmed
- unresolved direction
- not started
- in progress
- skipped for later
- completed
- permission deferred

## Forbidden States
- shame/failure framing
- productivity score or streak framing
- hidden mutation
- chatbot or assistant framing
- color-only warnings
- retired destination framing

## Motion and Haptic Intent
Motion clarifies origin, relationship, before/after, confirmation, and recovery. Haptics are light confirmation or boundary feedback only and never the sole indication. Continuous motion is allowed only when it communicates real state, not atmosphere.

## Accessibility Intent
The surface must preserve object, state, source/proof, action, and recovery meaning without depending on color, motion, small type, or visual layout. Primary actions require visible alternatives and readable contrast.

## Dynamic Type Intent
At larger sizes, preserve the dominant object, source/proof line, primary command, cancel/recovery path, and disclosure order even if secondary metadata collapses or moves below.

## VoiceOver Intent
VoiceOver order: destination or origin, surface name, primary object, current state, source/proof availability, primary action, secondary disclosure, cancel/recovery where relevant.

## Reduce Motion Intent
Replace animated continuity with static before/after labels, attachment lines, origin labels, and explicit receipt/source summaries. No meaning may depend only on movement.

## ADHD Usability Intent
Keep one dominant decision or one state explanation visible. Use short labels at rest, progressive disclosure for reasons, stable placement for cancel/undo/recovery, and no competing CTAs.

## Relationship to Planned Train / Source Families

- Visual Canon: quiet-luxury hierarchy, native primitives, and no generic dashboard drift.
- SI: shared chrome, reusable primitives, and the object-first interface language.
- Accessibility: Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, Reduce Motion, contrast, and visible alternatives.
- QA / validation: declared validation scope, explicit gaps, and no screenshot or implementation proof claims.
- Onboarding / First Run: calm first-use guidance and setup sequencing.
- Privacy: local runtime explanation and trust.

## Precedence / Conflict Notes
Final intended visual direction uses current truth files first, then planned frontend batch direction for future-state details; current source does not prove this recipe is implemented. Current implementation does not prove this surface exists or is complete.

## Forbidden Generic Drift
- generic dashboard
- card-stack fallback
- task-list clone
- calendar clone
- chatbot UI
- AI confidence or model jargon
- sportsbook or gambling language
- color-only state meaning
- shame language

## Open Direction Gaps
- None for final visual intent in this recipe pass.
