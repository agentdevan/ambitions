# Action Closure Recovery Canon

Status: PXOS future canon; not current app implementation truth
Date: 2026-05-02

## Purpose

Action Closure replaces binary success/failure. Supported states: Completed, Still Counts, Moved, Skipped / Not Needed, Blocked, Waiting, Needs Recovery, and Needs Review.

PXOS defines these states across Today, Step Detail, Step Session, Plan, Goals, You/history, receipts, and recovery sheets. Unclosed prior steps appear as soft closure prompts rather than stale Today items. Still Counts appears in closure/recovery sheets and relevant prompts, not everywhere.

Recovery language is calm, direct, and lightly supportive. The system must not shame the user, create guilt loops, treat all unfinished work as failure, or remove agency.

## Gates

- Product Decision Lock Gate: major choices must be locked by source truth or recorded as open/deferred.
- Surface Ownership Gate: every future UI change names Today, Goals, Capture, Plan, You, or a drill-down owner.
- Deep-Not-Wide Gate: deepen existing surfaces before creating new surface area.
- Accessibility / Cognitive Load Gate: future UI must specify Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, Reduce Motion, no color-only meaning, and cognitive-load expectations.
- Release Claim Gate: no release/platform/AI/personalization claim without evidence.
- ME Gate: no large UI expansion in known large-file zones without extraction review.
- CS Gate: no route/raw-value/external-surface/persistence breakage.

## Implementation Boundary

This is future canon and process guidance only. It does not implement app behavior, change production Swift, start PXOS, start AOS/ME/CS/REC02, retire compatibility seams, add dependencies, change workflows, add backend/sync/cloud/model runtime, or create release/platform readiness claims.
