Status: Queued after F23 Green

Scope:

- private projection tests
- What Ambitions Knows
- memory consent
- receipt/proof visibility

- notification/lock-screen assumptions
- no hidden personalization
- no unsupported AI claims
- local-only assumptions documented

Create `docs/audits/ambitions-3-0-f24-privacy-trust-qa-report.md`.

Trigger F24.5 if the threat model has unresolved blockers or memory/consent behavior is ambiguous.
