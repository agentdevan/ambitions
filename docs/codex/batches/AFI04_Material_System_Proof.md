Status: Complete / Accepted Yellow
Owner: Ambitions Flagship Interface
Scope: docs/canon, docs/codex, reports

## Purpose

Lock the proof rules for Celestial Field, Graphite Recess, Luminous Trace, and
Quiet Glass so future implementation cannot claim final material quality
without rendered evidence.

## Result

Accepted Yellow.

The active material canon now includes an AFI04 material proof matrix defining
each material's product job, pass evidence, Yellow boundary, and Hard Red
failure mode. Active design/material source truth now uses Time rather than
Plan as the top-level LifeShape Field surface.

## Validation

- Material proof matrix added to active materials canon.
- Highest design-system wording reconciled to Today / Goals / Capture / Time /
  You where the active top-level set is described.
- Global next-batch helper returns AFI05 after state updates.
- Docs/tooling validation only; no app source changed.

## Yellow Carry

Exact token values, material screenshots, preview evidence, performance review,
and accessibility material proof remain future validation work. AFI04 does not
claim current rendered UI, visual Green, or final-token status.
