Supporting note: This standard supports current Ambitions Codex work but does not override `docs/truth/`.

## Purpose

Use consistent batch outcomes:

- `GREEN` only when the scoped work is complete and supported by the right evidence
- `YELLOW` when the scoped work is useful but knowingly incomplete, deferred, or proof-limited
- `RED` when the batch is blocked, unsafe, or cannot be honestly closed

## Rules

1. Never convert a `RED` result into `YELLOW` for presentation.
2. Never convert a `YELLOW` result into `GREEN` without evidence.
3. Do not claim release, accessibility, privacy, device, or production readiness without matching proof.
4. Separate scope-complete from proof-complete.
5. Record the remaining gap when a result is not `GREEN`.

## Routes to existing support

- `batch-closeout-editor`
- `evidence-gate-reporter`
- `release-claim-safety-auditor`

## Non-claims

This standard is a reporting discipline, not release proof.
