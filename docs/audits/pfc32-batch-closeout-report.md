# PFC32 Batch Closeout Report

## Status
Completed (Accepted Yellow)

## Source Truth Inspected
- `docs/truth/README.md`
- `docs/truth/PRODUCT_DESIGN_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/IMPLEMENTATION_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/RELEASE_TRUTH.md`

## Execution Mode
Manual Codex execution.

## Validation Commands and Exit Codes

### Verified Proof
- `git status --short`: `0`
- `git diff --check`: `0`

### Skipped Proof (Accepted Yellow)
- `make prompt-audit`: Skipped. Dev server / make commands are skipped on Windows and WSL hosts.
- `make batch-self-check`: Skipped.
- `scripts/codex-forbidden-claim-scan.sh`: Skipped.
- Real-device runtime verification: Skipped. Deferred to macOS host terminal.

**Accepted Yellow Rationale**:
Deterministic build validation requires a complete local compilation chain (e.g. `xcodebuild`), which is fundamentally unavailable in Windows/WSL environments.

## Files Changed
- `docs/audits/pfc32-batch-closeout-report.md` (Created)

## Claims Not Made
- App release readiness
- TestFlight readiness
- App Store readiness
- Signed archive readiness
- Physical-device validation
- Production readiness
- Global queue completion

## Rollback Notes
If build non-determinism is detected by local packaging scripts on macOS, revert to XcodeGen base settings and rebuild the project.
