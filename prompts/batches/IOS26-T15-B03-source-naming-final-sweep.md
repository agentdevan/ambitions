# IOS26-T15-B03 - Sealed IOS26 Work Order

## Batch ID
`IOS26-T15-B03`

## Train ID and title
`TRAIN_15` - Repo hygiene, naming drift, historical quarantine

## Batch role in train
Batch 3 of 3 in TRAIN_15

## Upstream dependencies
- `TRAIN_00`
- `TRAIN_04K_for_naming_drift_and_generic_app_scan`

## Downstream dependencies
- none recorded

## Objective
Remove remaining active user-facing naming drift after prior trains.

## Product/canon constraints
- Active top-level IA remains `Today / Goals / Capture / Time / You`.
- Use `Start here`, `Recommended step`, `step`, `Start now`, and `Open step` where user-facing language is touched.
- Do not reintroduce `Plan` as a user-facing top-level destination.
- Do not convert Ambitions into a task app, calendar clone, habit tracker, status board, chatbot, AI wrapper, SaaS admin panel, or ranking-based productivity framing.

## Local-first/privacy constraints
No required cloud AI/LLM, hosted personal-data backend, tracking SDK, sensitive logs, or silent personal-data mutation. Preserve local-first/on-device-first behavior and privacy manifest honesty.

## Accessibility constraints
Classify source support separately from verified accessibility proof. Do not claim public accessibility verification unless current proof artifacts exist. Preserve Dynamic Type, VoiceOver order, Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast, and Reduce Transparency expectations where UI is touched.

## Performance constraints when relevant
Add measured performance evidence for any changed hot path, launch path, persistence path, or visual effect. If no measurement is possible, close Yellow with owner, reason, no-claim boundary, and follow-up gate.

## Champion Merge source boundary
- Champion Merge final status is accepted Yellow, not Red; IOS26 work may proceed only inside the no-claim boundaries below.
- Before source edits, inspect `docs/codex/canonical-owner-map.yml`, `docs/codex/concept-lock-registry.yml`, and `build/reports/intelligence-consolidation/TRAIN_04L_CLOSEOUT.md`.
- Extend the canonical owner for any touched concept. Do not create a new parallel owner or revive retired duplicate object names as active source/UI terms.
- Keep unresolved Yellow concepts locked against ordinary feature claims until their follow-up gate is Green or owner-accepted.
- Docs/naming sweeps must preserve `docs/codex/canonical-owner-map.yml` and `docs/codex/concept-lock-registry.yml` as source-boundary inputs and must not reopen resolved Champion Merge concepts.

## Allowed files/directories
User-facing strings, accessibility IDs, tests, adapter boundaries.

## Forbidden files/directories
No breaking legacy deep links without adapter tests.

## Exact implementation steps
Run drift grep; rename only active user-facing/test drift; keep legacy terms only in route adapters, historical docs, explicit compatibility tests; update tests; produce report.

## Validation commands
```bash
xcodegen generate
scripts/build-local.sh
xcodebuild -project Ambitions.xcodeproj -scheme Ambitions -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=<available simulator>" -only-testing:AmbitionsTests test
```

## Green / Yellow / Red gates
Green: scoped changes complete, commands/proof recorded, no forbidden edits or overclaims.
Yellow: environment/proof gaps are explicit, owner/gate recorded, no release/privacy/accessibility/performance/device/App Store claim is made.
Red: forbidden source/runtime/project mutation outside scope, unverified API adoption, privacy/local-first breach, release/readiness overclaim, or missing required truth-file read.

## Rollback behavior
Revert only files touched by this batch. Do not use broad reset or discard unrelated work. Delete malformed generated reports if this is docs/proof only.

## Claims allowed
- This batch may claim only source, test, and proof outcomes directly demonstrated by current logs and artifacts.
- Docs-only or tooling-only changes must be described as docs-only or tooling-only.

## Claims forbidden
- No release readiness, TestFlight readiness, App Store readiness, CI proof, device proof, accessibility verification, performance validation, privacy/legal approval, or Private Life Runtime moat completion without matching current proof.

# IOS26-T15-B03 — Source naming final sweep

## Batch type
Naming drift closure

## Objective
Remove remaining active user-facing naming drift after prior trains.

## Why this exists
Compatibility seams should not leak into UI/tests/docs.

## Dependencies
Train 6, Train 7, Train 12.

## Truth files to read
- `docs/truth/README.md`
- `docs/truth/PRODUCT_DESIGN_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/PRODUCT_MOAT_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/IMPLEMENTATION_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/RELEASE_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/CODEX_PROCESS_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/HISTORICAL_POLICY.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/README.md`
- `project.yml`
- `Package.swift`

## Exact source areas to inspect
Native/Ambitions; Sources; AppUI; unit/UI tests; docs/truth.

## Exact changes allowed
User-facing strings, accessibility IDs, tests, adapter boundaries.

## Exact changes forbidden
No breaking legacy deep links without adapter tests.

## Implementation steps
Run drift grep; rename only active user-facing/test drift; keep legacy terms only in route adapters, historical docs, explicit compatibility tests; update tests; produce report.

## Tests to add/update
Naming/copy tests.

## Commands to run
```bash
xcodegen generate
scripts/build-local.sh
xcodebuild -project Ambitions.xcodeproj -scheme Ambitions -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=<available simulator>" -only-testing:AmbitionsTests test
```

## Required proof artifacts
build/reports/repo-hygiene/source-naming-final-sweep.md

## Accessibility requirements
Classify source support separately from verified accessibility proof. Do not claim public accessibility verification unless current proof artifacts exist. Preserve Dynamic Type, VoiceOver order, Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast, and Reduce Transparency expectations where UI is touched.

## Privacy/local-first requirements
No required cloud AI/LLM, hosted personal-data backend, tracking SDK, sensitive logs, or silent personal-data mutation. Preserve local-first/on-device-first behavior and privacy manifest honesty.

## iOS 26 API verification requirements
Internal symbols require owner if retained.

## Green / Yellow / Red closeout rules
Green: scoped changes complete, commands/proof recorded, no forbidden edits or overclaims.
Yellow: environment/proof gaps are explicit, owner/gate recorded, no release/privacy/accessibility/performance/device/App Store claim is made.
Red: forbidden source/runtime/project mutation outside scope, unverified API adoption, privacy/local-first breach, release/readiness overclaim, or missing required truth-file read.

## Rollback strategy
Revert only files touched by this batch. Do not use broad reset or discard unrelated work. Delete malformed generated reports if this is docs/proof only.
