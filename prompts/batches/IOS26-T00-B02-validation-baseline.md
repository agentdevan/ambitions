# IOS26-T00-B02 - Sealed IOS26 Work Order

## Batch ID
`IOS26-T00-B02`

## Train ID and title
`TRAIN_00` - Repo truth, audit, validation baseline

## Batch role in train
Batch 2 of 3 in TRAIN_00

## Upstream dependencies
- none

## Downstream dependencies
- `TRAIN_01`
- `TRAIN_03`
- `TRAIN_15`

## Objective
Attempt current local validation and record proof or blockers.

## Product/canon constraints
- Active top-level IA remains `Today / Goals / Capture / Time / You`.
- Use `Start here`, `Recommended step`, `step`, `Start now`, and `Open step` where user-facing language is touched.
- Do not reintroduce `Plan` as a user-facing top-level destination.
- Do not convert Ambitions into a task app, calendar clone, habit tracker, dashboard, chatbot, AI wrapper, SaaS admin panel, or score-based productivity app.

## Local-first/privacy constraints
No required cloud AI/LLM, hosted personal-data backend, tracking SDK, sensitive logs, or silent personal-data mutation. Preserve local-first/on-device-first behavior and privacy manifest honesty.

## Accessibility constraints
Classify source support separately from verified accessibility proof. Do not claim public accessibility verification unless current proof artifacts exist. Preserve Dynamic Type, VoiceOver order, Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast, and Reduce Transparency expectations where UI is touched.

## Performance constraints when relevant
Add measured performance evidence for any changed hot path, launch path, persistence path, or visual effect. If no measurement is possible, close Yellow with owner, reason, no-claim boundary, and follow-up gate.

## Champion Merge source boundary
- Champion Merge final status is accepted Yellow, not Red; IOS26 work may proceed only inside the no-claim boundaries below.
- Before source edits, inspect `docs/codex/canonical-owner-map.yml`, `docs/codex/concept-lock-registry.yml`, and `build/reports/intelligence-consolidation/TRAIN_04L_CLOSEOUT.md`.
- Extend the canonical owner for any touched concept. Do not create a new parallel owner or revive retired duplicate object names as active source/UI terms.
- Keep unresolved Yellow concepts locked against ordinary feature claims until their follow-up gate is Green or owner-accepted.

## Allowed files/directories
build/reports/ios26-baseline/commands-run.md; build/reports/ios26-baseline/log-index.md; docs/audits/ios26-validation-baseline.md

## Forbidden files/directories
No source repairs in this batch.

## Exact implementation steps
Record environment and exact commands; run allowed commands if environment permits; save logs or summarize existing logs; mark every skipped command with reason; do not repair failures.

## Validation commands
```bash
git status --short
xcodebuild -version
xcodebuild -showsdks
xcrun simctl list runtimes
xcrun simctl list devices available
xcodegen --version
swift --version
swift package dump-package
xcodegen generate
scripts/build-local.sh
```

## Green / Yellow / Red gates
Green: scoped changes complete, commands/proof recorded, no forbidden edits or overclaims.
Yellow: environment/proof gaps are explicit, owner/gate recorded, no release/privacy/accessibility/performance/device/App Store claim is made.
Red: forbidden source/runtime/project mutation outside scope, unverified API adoption, privacy/local-first breach, release/readiness overclaim, or missing required truth-file read.

## Rollback behavior
Revert only files touched by this batch. Do not use broad reset or discard unrelated work. Delete malformed generated reports if this is docs/proof only.

## Claims allowed
- This batch may claim only source, test, and proof outcomes directly demonstrated by current logs and artifacts.
- Docs-only or tooling-only changes must be described as docs-only or tooling-only.

## Claims forbidden
- No release readiness, TestFlight readiness, App Store readiness, CI proof, device proof, accessibility verification, performance validation, privacy/legal approval, or Private Life Runtime moat completion without matching current proof.

# IOS26-T00-B02 — Validation baseline

## Batch type
Validation/proof baseline

## Objective
Attempt current local validation and record proof or blockers.

## Why this exists
Build/test status must be known before migration.

## Dependencies
IOS26-T00-B01.

## Truth files to read
- `docs/truth/README.md`
- `docs/truth/PRODUCT_DESIGN_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/PRODUCT_MOAT_TRUTH.md`

xcodebuild -showsdks
xcrun simctl list runtimes
xcrun simctl list devices available
xcodegen --version
swift --version
swift package dump-package
xcodegen generate
scripts/build-local.sh
```

## Required proof artifacts
Command log index with exit codes.

## Accessibility requirements

## Privacy/local-first requirements
No required cloud AI/LLM, hosted personal-data backend, tracking SDK, sensitive logs, or silent personal-data mutation. Preserve local-first/on-device-first behavior and privacy manifest honesty.

## iOS 26 API verification requirements
Record whether iOS 26 SDK/runtime exists.

## Green / Yellow / Red closeout rules
Green: scoped changes complete, commands/proof recorded, no forbidden edits or overclaims.
Yellow: environment/proof gaps are explicit, owner/gate recorded, no release/privacy/accessibility/performance/device/App Store claim is made.
Red: forbidden source/runtime/project mutation outside scope, unverified API adoption, privacy/local-first breach, release/readiness overclaim, or missing required truth-file read.

## Rollback strategy
Revert only files touched by this batch. Do not use broad reset or discard unrelated work. Delete malformed generated reports if this is docs/proof only.
