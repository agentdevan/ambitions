# IOS26-T03-B01 - Sealed IOS26 Work Order

## Batch ID
`IOS26-T03-B01`

## Train ID and title
`NON_MANIFEST_IOS26_PROMPT` - Non-manifest IOS26 support prompt

## Batch role in train
Supporting prompt outside manifest batch matrix

## Upstream dependencies
- none

## Downstream dependencies
- none recorded

## Objective
Introduce Private Life Runtime kernel contracts without breaking existing services.

## Product/canon constraints
- Active top-level IA remains `Today / Goals / Capture / Time / You`.
- Use `Start here`, `Recommended step`, `step`, `Start now`, and `Open step` where user-facing language is touched.
- Do not reintroduce `Plan` as a user-facing top-level destination.
- Do not convert Ambitions into a task app, calendar clone, habit tracker, dashboard, chatbot, AI wrapper, SaaS admin panel, or score-based productivity app.

## Local-first/privacy constraints
No required cloud AI/LLM, hosted personal-data backend, tracking SDK, sensitive logs, or silent personal-data mutation. Preserve local-first/on-device-first behavior and privacy manifest honesty.

## Accessibility constraints
Classify source support separately from verified accessibility proof. Do not claim public accessibility verification unless current proof artifacts exist. Preserve Dynamic Type, VoiceOver order, Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast, and Reduce Transparency expectations where UI is touched.

## Performance constraints when relevant
Add measured performance evidence for any changed hot path, launch path, persistence path, or visual effect. If no measurement is possible, close Yellow with owner, reason, no-claim boundary, and follow-up gate.

## Allowed files/directories
Runtime contracts, adapter models, tests.

## Forbidden files/directories
No cloud/backend/LLM dependencies. No UI changes.

## Exact implementation steps
Add kernel protocol/equivalent, trace context, decision input/output/record; wrap/adapt existing factory behavior; prove local-only boundary.

## Validation commands
```bash
xcodegen generate
scripts/build-local.sh
xcodebuild -project Ambitions.xcodeproj -scheme Ambitions -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=<available simulator>" -only-testing:AmbitionsTests test
```

## Proof artifacts to write
build/reports/private-life-runtime/kernel-contracts.md


## Green / Yellow / Red gates
Green: scoped changes complete, commands/proof recorded, no forbidden edits or overclaims.
Yellow: environment/proof gaps are explicit, owner/gate recorded, no release/privacy/accessibility/performance/device/App Store claim is made.
Red: forbidden source/runtime/project mutation outside scope, unverified API adoption, privacy/local-first breach, release/readiness overclaim, or missing required truth-file read.

## Rollback behavior
Revert only files touched by this batch. Do not use broad reset or discard unrelated work. Delete malformed generated reports if this is docs/proof only.

## Claims allowed
- This batch may claim only source, test, and proof outcomes directly demonstrated by current logs and artifacts.
- Docs-only or tooling-only changes must be described as docs-only or tooling-only.

## Claims forbidden
- No release readiness, TestFlight readiness, App Store readiness, CI proof, device proof, accessibility verification, performance validation, privacy/legal approval, or Private Life Runtime moat completion without matching current proof.

# IOS26-T03-B01 — Runtime kernel contracts

## Batch type
Runtime architecture

## Objective
Introduce Private Life Runtime kernel contracts without breaking existing services.

## Why this exists
The moat needs one inspectable deterministic decision boundary.

## Dependencies
Train 0 and Train 1.

## Truth files to read
- `docs/truth/README.md`
- `docs/truth/PRODUCT_DESIGN_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/PRODUCT_MOAT_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/IMPLEMENTATION_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/RELEASE_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/CODEX_PROCESS_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/HISTORICAL_POLICY.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/README.md`
- `project.yml`
- `Package.swift`

## Exact source areas to inspect
Native/Ambitions/Runtime/; Native/Ambitions/Domain/; Native/Ambitions/Services/; Native/AmbitionsTests/Runtime/.

## Exact changes allowed
Runtime contracts, adapter models, tests.

## Exact changes forbidden
No cloud/backend/LLM dependencies. No UI changes.

## Implementation steps
Add kernel protocol/equivalent, trace context, decision input/output/record; wrap/adapt existing factory behavior; prove local-only boundary.

## Tests to add/update
Runtime unit tests.

## Commands to run
```bash
xcodegen generate
scripts/build-local.sh
xcodebuild -project Ambitions.xcodeproj -scheme Ambitions -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=<available simulator>" -only-testing:AmbitionsTests test
```

## Required proof artifacts
build/reports/private-life-runtime/kernel-contracts.md

## Accessibility requirements
Classify source support separately from verified accessibility proof. Do not claim public accessibility verification unless current proof artifacts exist. Preserve Dynamic Type, VoiceOver order, Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast, and Reduce Transparency expectations where UI is touched.

## Privacy/local-first requirements
No required cloud AI/LLM, hosted personal-data backend, tracking SDK, sensitive logs, or silent personal-data mutation. Preserve local-first/on-device-first behavior and privacy manifest honesty.

## iOS 26 API verification requirements
No external AI/backend introduced.

## Green / Yellow / Red closeout rules
Green: scoped changes complete, commands/proof recorded, no forbidden edits or overclaims.
Yellow: environment/proof gaps are explicit, owner/gate recorded, no release/privacy/accessibility/performance/device/App Store claim is made.
Red: forbidden source/runtime/project mutation outside scope, unverified API adoption, privacy/local-first breach, release/readiness overclaim, or missing required truth-file read.

## Rollback strategy
Revert only files touched by this batch. Do not use broad reset or discard unrelated work. Delete malformed generated reports if this is docs/proof only.
