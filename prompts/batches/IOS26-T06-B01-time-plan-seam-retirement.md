# IOS26-T06-B01 — Time / Plan seam retirement

## Batch type
Naming/route compatibility

## Objective
Retire active user-facing Plan seams while preserving safe legacy route compatibility.

## Why this exists
Time is canonical; Plan is not a top-level product object.

## Dependencies
Train 0 and Train 1.

## Truth files to read
- `docs/truth/README.md`
- `docs/truth/PRODUCT_DESIGN_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/PRODUCT_MOAT_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/IMPLEMENTATION_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/RELEASE_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/CODEX_PROCESS_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/HISTORICAL_POLICY.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/README.md`
- `project.yml`
- `Package.swift`

## Exact source areas to inspect
App routing; Time feature; AppIntents; UI/unit tests; docs/truth.

## Exact changes allowed
Route adapters, accessibility IDs, tests, user-facing copy.

## Exact changes forbidden
Do not break legacy deep links unless adapter tests are updated.

## Implementation steps
Split canonical Time from legacy Plan alias; rename user-facing IDs; keep ambitions://tab/plan as legacy alias if needed; update tests; add grep proof.

## Tests to add/update
Route and UI tests.

## Commands to run
```bash
xcodegen generate
scripts/build-local.sh
xcodebuild -project Ambitions.xcodeproj -scheme Ambitions -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=<available simulator>" -only-testing:AmbitionsTests test
```

## Required proof artifacts
build/reports/lifeshape-field/plan-seam-retirement.md

## Accessibility requirements
Classify source support separately from verified accessibility proof. Do not claim public accessibility verification unless current proof artifacts exist. Preserve Dynamic Type, VoiceOver order, Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast, and Reduce Transparency expectations where UI is touched.

## Privacy/local-first requirements
No required cloud AI/LLM, hosted personal-data backend, tracking SDK, sensitive logs, or silent personal-data mutation. Preserve local-first/on-device-first behavior and privacy manifest honesty.

## iOS 26 API verification requirements
Plan can remain compatibility-only.

## Green / Yellow / Red closeout rules
Green: scoped changes complete, commands/proof recorded, no forbidden edits or overclaims.
Yellow: environment/proof gaps are explicit, owner/gate recorded, no release/privacy/accessibility/performance/device/App Store claim is made.
Red: forbidden source/runtime/project mutation outside scope, unverified API adoption, privacy/local-first breach, release/readiness overclaim, or missing required truth-file read.

## Rollback strategy
Revert only files touched by this batch. Do not use broad reset or discard unrelated work. Delete malformed generated reports if this is docs/proof only.
