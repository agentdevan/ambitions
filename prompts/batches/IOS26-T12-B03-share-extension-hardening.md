# IOS26-T12-B03 - Sealed IOS26 Work Order

## Batch ID
`IOS26-T12-B03`

## Train ID and title
`TRAIN_12` - Widgets, Live Activities, App Intents, share extension

## Batch role in train
Batch 3 of 3 in TRAIN_12

## Upstream dependencies
- `TRAIN_02`
- `TRAIN_10`
- `TRAIN_11`
- `TRAIN_04K_where_widgets_App_Intents_share_extension_expose_life_objects`

## Downstream dependencies
- none recorded

## Objective
Harden share extension input, receipt, accessibility, and failure behavior.

## Product/canon constraints
- Active top-level IA remains `Today / Goals / Capture / Time / You`.
- Use `Start here`, `Recommended step`, `step`, `Start now`, and `Open step` where user-facing language is touched.
- Do not reintroduce `Plan` as a user-facing top-level destination.
- Do not convert Ambitions into a task app, calendar clone, habit tracker, dashboard, chatbot, AI wrapper, SaaS admin panel, or score-based productivity app.

## Local-first/privacy constraints
No required cloud AI/LLM, hosted personal-data backend, tracking SDK, sensitive logs, or silent personal-data mutation. Preserve local-first/on-device-first behavior and privacy manifest honesty.

## Accessibility constraints
Classify source support separately from verified accessibility proof. Do not claim public accessibility verification unless current proof artifacts exist. Preserve Dynamic Type, VoiceOver order, Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast, and Reduce Transparency expectations where UI is touched.

## Performance constraints when relevant
Add measured performance evidence for any changed hot path, launch path, persistence path, or visual effect. If no measurement is possible, close Yellow with owner, reason, no-claim boundary, and follow-up gate.

## Allowed files/directories
Share extension UI/intake service/tests.

## Forbidden files/directories
No sensitive debug logs. No unconfirmed goal creation.

## Exact implementation steps
Handle empty/large/URL/text/unknown type; add local receipt/provenance; add accessible labels/failure copy; test request creation and landing route.

## Validation commands
```bash
xcodegen generate
scripts/build-local.sh
xcodebuild -project Ambitions.xcodeproj -scheme Ambitions -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=<available simulator>" -only-testing:AmbitionsTests test
```

## Green / Yellow / Red gates
Green: scoped changes complete, commands/proof recorded, no forbidden edits or overclaims.
Yellow: environment/proof gaps are explicit, owner/gate recorded, no release/privacy/accessibility/performance/device/App Store claim is made.
Red: forbidden source/runtime/project mutation outside scope, unverified API adoption, privacy/local-first breach, release/readiness overclaim, or missing required truth-file read.

## Rollback behavior
Revert only files touched by this batch. Do not use broad reset or discard unrelated work. Delete malformed generated reports if this is docs/proof only.

## Claims allowed
- This batch may claim only source, test, and proof outcomes directly demonstrated by current logs and artifacts.
- Docs-only or tooling-only changes must be described as docs-only or tooling-only.

## Claims forbidden
- No release readiness, TestFlight readiness, App Store readiness, CI proof, device proof, accessibility verification, performance validation, privacy/legal approval, or Private Life Runtime moat completion without matching current proof.

# IOS26-T12-B03 — Share extension hardening

## Batch type
Share extension

## Objective
Harden share extension input, receipt, accessibility, and failure behavior.

## Why this exists
Share intake must not lose or leak user input.

## Dependencies
Train 8, Train 11.

## Truth files to read
- `docs/truth/README.md`
- `docs/truth/PRODUCT_DESIGN_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/PRODUCT_MOAT_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/IMPLEMENTATION_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/RELEASE_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/CODEX_PROCESS_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/HISTORICAL_POLICY.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/README.md`
- `project.yml`
- `Package.swift`

## Exact source areas to inspect
Share extension; ExternalSnapshots; Capture feature; tests.

## Exact changes allowed
Share extension UI/intake service/tests.

## Exact changes forbidden
No sensitive debug logs. No unconfirmed goal creation.

## Implementation steps
Handle empty/large/URL/text/unknown type; add local receipt/provenance; add accessible labels/failure copy; test request creation and landing route.

## Tests to add/update
Share intake tests.

## Commands to run
```bash
xcodegen generate
scripts/build-local.sh
xcodebuild -project Ambitions.xcodeproj -scheme Ambitions -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=<available simulator>" -only-testing:AmbitionsTests test
```

## Required proof artifacts
build/reports/external-surfaces/share-extension.md

## Accessibility requirements
Classify source support separately from verified accessibility proof. Do not claim public accessibility verification unless current proof artifacts exist. Preserve Dynamic Type, VoiceOver order, Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast, and Reduce Transparency expectations where UI is touched.

## Privacy/local-first requirements
No required cloud AI/LLM, hosted personal-data backend, tracking SDK, sensitive logs, or silent personal-data mutation. Preserve local-first/on-device-first behavior and privacy manifest honesty.

## iOS 26 API verification requirements
Manual share sheet proof can remain Yellow.

## Green / Yellow / Red closeout rules
Green: scoped changes complete, commands/proof recorded, no forbidden edits or overclaims.
Yellow: environment/proof gaps are explicit, owner/gate recorded, no release/privacy/accessibility/performance/device/App Store claim is made.
Red: forbidden source/runtime/project mutation outside scope, unverified API adoption, privacy/local-first breach, release/readiness overclaim, or missing required truth-file read.

## Rollback strategy
Revert only files touched by this batch. Do not use broad reset or discard unrelated work. Delete malformed generated reports if this is docs/proof only.
