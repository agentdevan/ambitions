# IOS26-T07-B01 - Sealed IOS26 Work Order

## Batch ID
`IOS26-T07-B01`

## Train ID and title
`TRAIN_07` - Goals / Constellation Atlas final object

## Batch role in train
Batch 1 of 3 in TRAIN_07

## Upstream dependencies
- `TRAIN_04`
- `TRAIN_04A`
- `TRAIN_04B`
- `TRAIN_04C`
- `TRAIN_04D`
- `TRAIN_04K`
- `TRAIN_04L`

## Downstream dependencies
- none recorded

## Objective
Make Constellation Atlas the primary Goals root.

## Product/canon constraints
- Active top-level IA remains `Today / Goals / Capture / Time / You`.
- Use `Start here`, `Recommended step`, `step`, `Start now`, and `Open step` where user-facing language is touched.
- Do not reintroduce `Plan` as a user-facing top-level destination.
- Do not convert Ambitions into a task app, calendar clone, habit tracker, status board, chatbot, AI wrapper, SaaS admin panel, or ranking-based productivity framing.

## Local-first/privacy constraints
No required cloud AI/LLM, hosted personal-data backend, tracking SDK, sensitive logs, or silent personal-data mutation. Preserve local-first/on-device-first behavior and privacy manifest honesty.

## Accessibility constraints
Classify source support separately from verified accessibility proof. Do not claim public accessibility verification unless current proof artifacts exist. Preserve Dynamic Type, VoiceOver order, Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast, and Reduce Transparency expectations where UI is touched.

## Performance constraints when relevant
Add measured performance evidence for any changed hot path, launch path, persistence path, or visual effect. If no measurement is possible, close Yellow with owner, reason, no-claim boundary, and follow-up gate.

## Champion Merge source boundary
- Champion Merge final status is accepted Yellow, not Red; IOS26 work may proceed only inside the no-claim boundaries below.
- Before source edits, inspect `docs/codex/canonical-owner-map.yml`, `docs/codex/concept-lock-registry.yml`, and `build/reports/intelligence-consolidation/TRAIN_04L_CLOSEOUT.md`.
- Extend the canonical owner for any touched concept. Do not create a new parallel owner or revive retired duplicate object names as active source/UI terms.
- Keep unresolved Yellow concepts locked against ordinary feature claims until their follow-up gate is Green or owner-accepted.
- `goals_root` owns Goals / GoalThread behavior under `Native/Ambitions/Features/Goals` and `Native/Ambitions/Domain`; do not create a goals status board or duplicate Mission Control owners.

## Allowed files/directories
Goals UI/root composition, atlas models/tests/previews.

## Forbidden files/directories
No KPI/rings/life-score dashboards.

## Exact implementation steps
Create/promote ConstellationAtlasSurface; make relationships primary; demote board/lanes/depth; update tests/previews.

## Object frontend expansion directives
- Build the Atlas as a solar-system-like object surface with life areas as planets or regions.
- Represent goals as adaptive bodies, thread origins, or region markers instead of generic cards.
- Make Goal Threads first-class and visible.
- Add a scrubbable timeline that shows all steps for the active goal thread.
- Remove goal-card, list, kanban, KPI, ring, score, and dashboard roots.
- Run `python3 scripts/ios26-anti-card-check.py --surface goals --batch IOS26-T07-B01` and write the resulting frontend-object-purity proof reports.

## Validation commands
```bash
xcodegen generate
scripts/build-local.sh
python3 scripts/ios26-anti-card-check.py --surface goals --batch IOS26-T07-B01
xcodebuild -project Ambitions.xcodeproj -scheme Ambitions -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=<available simulator>" -only-testing:AmbitionsTests test

## Green / Yellow / Red gates
Green: scoped changes complete, commands/proof recorded, no forbidden edits or overclaims.
Yellow: environment/proof gaps are explicit, owner/gate recorded, no release/privacy/accessibility/performance/device/App Store claim is made.
Red: forbidden source/runtime/project mutation outside scope, unverified API adoption, privacy/local-first breach, release/readiness overclaim, or missing required truth-file read.

## Rollback behavior
Revert only files touched by this batch. Do not use broad reset or discard unrelated work. Delete malformed generated reports if this is docs/proof only.

## Claims allowed
- This batch may claim only source, test, and proof outcomes directly demonstrated by current logs and artifacts.
- Docs-only or tooling-only changes must be described as docs-only or tooling-only.

## Claims forbidden
- No release readiness, TestFlight readiness, App Store readiness, CI proof, device proof, accessibility verification, performance validation, privacy/legal approval, or Private Life Runtime moat completion without matching current proof.

# IOS26-T07-B01 — Constellation Atlas root

## Batch type
Goals UI final object

## Objective
Make Constellation Atlas the primary Goals root.

## Why this exists
Goals should show relationships and direction, not board/task inventory.

## Dependencies
Train 4.

## Truth files to read
- `docs/truth/README.md`
- `docs/truth/PRODUCT_DESIGN_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/truth/PRODUCT_MOAT_TRUTH.md`

## Exact source areas to inspect
Goals feature; Domain; Runtime; tests.

## Exact changes allowed
Goals UI/root composition, atlas models/tests/previews.

## Exact changes forbidden
No KPI/rings/life-score dashboards.

## Implementation steps
Create/promote ConstellationAtlasSurface; make relationships primary; demote board/lanes/depth; update tests/previews.

## Tests to add/update

## Commands to run
```bash
xcodegen generate
scripts/build-local.sh
xcodebuild -project Ambitions.xcodeproj -scheme Ambitions -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=<available simulator>" -only-testing:AmbitionsTests test
```

## Required proof artifacts
build/reports/constellation-atlas/root.md

## Accessibility requirements
Classify source support separately from verified accessibility proof. Do not claim public accessibility verification unless current proof artifacts exist. Preserve Dynamic Type, VoiceOver order, Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast, and Reduce Transparency expectations where UI is touched.

## Privacy/local-first requirements
No required cloud AI/LLM, hosted personal-data backend, tracking SDK, sensitive logs, or silent personal-data mutation. Preserve local-first/on-device-first behavior and privacy manifest honesty.

## iOS 26 API verification requirements
Atlas primary; dashboard/board not primary.

## Green / Yellow / Red closeout rules
Green: scoped changes complete, commands/proof recorded, no forbidden edits or overclaims.
Yellow: environment/proof gaps are explicit, owner/gate recorded, no release/privacy/accessibility/performance/device/App Store claim is made.
Red: forbidden source/runtime/project mutation outside scope, unverified API adoption, privacy/local-first breach, release/readiness overclaim, or missing required truth-file read.

## Rollback strategy
Revert only files touched by this batch. Do not use broad reset or discard unrelated work. Delete malformed generated reports if this is docs/proof only.
